coursera Algorithm Design and Analysis part I
Week 6 - programming questions test cases


The tests were generated randomly and they contain the same amount
of input data (the same numbers of integers, rows etc.)
as in the original programming assignment.

Here are the answers provided by my programs
(they may be incorrect!):

Median problem:
med.txt:  1666
med2.txt: 4758
med3.txt: 4011

2 sum problem:
2sum.txt: 1453


Good luck!
